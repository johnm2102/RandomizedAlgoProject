# RandomizedAlgo
Implementation of two algorithms that help analyse a large stream of data.
Completed in CSharp, this will be divided into 3 parts: 

First part focussing on Hashing with Chaining, where an implementation of a hash table with chaining will be done, to determine the quadratic stream of a large sum of data.

The second part will focus on the streams to test the data structures 

The final part will focus on count-sketch analysis for the same data stream from Part 1, to determine the faster runtime
